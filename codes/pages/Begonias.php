    Begonias are perhaps one of the most enduring and traditional houseplants you'll come across. They're easily loved but can equally be hated for being "old fashioned plants Grandmother used to grow".

Begonia corallina in flowerRegardless, for the most part they're easy going, tolerant and somewhat forgiving of occasional poor care. The choice in variety is truly huge with close to 1000 species and thousands of cultivars. While almost all commercially grown Begonias are cheap to purchase some of the rarer varieties could set you back a little.

The sheer diversity on offer means there is likely something for everyone. Some of the popular names you'll find on the plant labels are "Wax Begonia", "Angel Wing Begonia" and "Rex Begonia".

Broadly, the type of Begonia you can grow as a houseplant will fall into one of two categories. There are the foliage types, which are grown primarily for their aesthetically pleasing and unusual leaf shapes, colorings and markings. There are so many varieties and different looking foliage Begonias to pick from, so just choose the patterns you like best when purchasing.

The second option are the flowering types with their impressive blooms. The leaves might not be much to look at this time around, but the blooms more than make up for this. Again pick a plant you like the look of choosing one with only a few flowers open and plenty of buds to prolong the display.

Once you've either a flowering or foliage type of Begonia it's further divided into groups based on how it looks or how it grows. The most popular types are are Cane, Rhizomatous and Tuberous Begonias. A Pink flowering Cane BegoniaThe care requirements are quite similar, but each will have a little difference that you need to be aware of and respect for a successful long term relationship.

The Cane Begonias (right) were likely the indoor plants grown by your Grandmother, with their brittle thick canes that had slightly hairy knobbly stems giving an almost arthritic appearance, which is not attractive by today's standards.

The variety on offer is huge and thankfully the modern varieties that are commonly sold are often a little more compact and less "leggy". They can still spread far and wide if you let them however so it's important to keep them pruned and trained if you want to maintain a smaller controlled looking houseplant.

All the Cane Begonias are typically evergreen meaning they can be kept indoors all year round as permanent house guests without losing leaves in Winter. Flowering is possible at any time of the year but during the Autumn and Winter months are the most common.

Several tuberous Begonias in flower showing off huge bloomsThe Tuberous Begonias (right) are popular with outdoors gardeners because of the wonderful flower display they put on over the Summer that last for months and months. This is also the same reason they're grown indoors as houseplants.

The tubers which grow under the soil surface store a huge amount of energy which in turn allow for some impressive looking large flowers that are produced for most of the Summer. After flowering has finished it's typical for the plant to enter dormancy.

You can grow these houseplants from year to year (see anything else section), but their need for dormancy to recover for next years display means they'll only be a temporary house guest.

Escargot is a Rhizomatous BegoniaThe Rhizomatous Begonias (right) are normally the foliage types, and have a possible advantage of being much smaller than the Cane and Tuberous Begonias.

They often flower in Spring and although the blooms might not be as impressive as the flowering types, this is probably the more balanced Begonia plant overall it. It has attractive foliage to keep you entertained all year around, does not die back in Winter and still gives you some blooms to appreciate.
